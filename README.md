This is my implementation of the Wordle game, a game where you have 6 tries to guess a 5 letter word.

## Quick start
The game is hosted online, you can play it [here](http://54.226.222.83).

## Tech stack
### Backend
The server operates on NodeJS, and uses MongoDB

### Frontend
It's just a React App

### DevOps
The game consists of 2 containers: NodeJS and MongoDB. It is being hosted on an AWS EC2 instance

### Testing
For testing Jest was used alongside with Postman for the API endpoints

## Plans for future
* API documentation
* 
Other than that I do not plan any further development on this app as I believe it served it's purpose as a fun learning experience.
